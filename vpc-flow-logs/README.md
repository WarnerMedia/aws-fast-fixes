# enable-vpc-flowlogs

This script will enable vpc flow logs in your account.

## Why?

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flowlogs will be delivered to the S3 bucket specified by the value of `--flowlog-bucket` with the region appended to the end. It is assumed the S3 Bucket exists and is configured to allow the log service to write to it. After you've created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination. 

## What the script does.

This script will iterate through all your regions, through all VPCs in each region and enable flow logs for each VPC.

## Usage

```bash
usage: enable-vpc-flowlogs.py [-h] [--debug] [--error] [--timestamp] [--region REGION] [--profile PROFILE] [--vpc-id VPC_ID] [--actually-do-it] --flowlog-bucket FLOWLOG_BUCKET_PREFIX

arguments:
  --flowlog-bucket       FLOWLOG_BUCKET S3 bucket for flow log destination (may not be used with --make-bucket)
  --make-bucket         Make bucket for flow log destination (may not be used with --flowlog-bucket)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --debug               print debugging info
  --error               print error info only
  --timestamp           Output log with timestamp and toolname
  --region REGION       Only Process Specified Region
  --profile PROFILE      Use this CLI profile (instead of default or env credentials)
  --vpc-id VPC_ID       Only Process Specified VPC
  --actually-do-it      Actually Perform the action
  --traffic-type         The type of traffic to log
  --force               Replace flowlog replacement without prompt
```

You must specify `--actually-do-it` for the changes to be made. Otherwise the script runs in dry-run mode only.

> Cross region note:
> 
> We assume the use of regions that allow cross-region log delivery. This tool does not support opt-in regions as defined here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html  
> Excerpt:
> 
>     ```
>     If you create a flow log in a Region introduced after March 20, 2019 (an opt-in Region), such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) or Middle East (Bahrain), the destination Amazon S3 bucket must be in the same Region and the same AWS account as the flow log.
>     
>     If you create a flow log in a Region introduced before March 20, 2019, the destination Amazon S3 bucket must be in the same Region as the flow log, or in another Region introduced before March 20, 2019. You cannot specify an Amazon S3 bucket that's in an opt-in Region.
